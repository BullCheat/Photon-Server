# TODO
Here are the tasks to do for the next Server version (or a future one). Update this file when you start working on something,
and when you're done. You don't have to complete a task entirely before making a pull request (let us now in that case).
- [ ] *WIP (TheElectronWill)* - Implement user authentication with the mojang's servers.
- [ ] Implement user storage.
- [ ] Implement world storage. World would not be stored with the minecraft "anvil" format, but with the chunkdata's packet format, to allow better performance.
- [ ] Implement the Photon API entirely.
- [ ] *WIP (TheElectronWill)* - Rewrite the threading model. **See the discussion group.**
