# Photon Server
Photon server implementation of the API. **Supports Minecraft version 1.9** (and its subversions like 1.9.1, 1.9.2, etc).

## How to build
Photon uses [gradle](http://gradle.org) to manage the dependencies. The files `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` are provided in this github repository. The simplest way for you to build Photon-Server is probably to create a gradle project in your favorite IDE (you may need to install a plugin for that), and to copy the Photon-Server's content into this project (replace existing files).
